Gentlemen, Chest Numbers [dash], [dash], and [dash] are all concluding on the same point. Instead of repeating it, let’s implement it first. If it doesn’t work, we can move to other ideas.

Gentlemen, I’ll tie to make it stable, as I have a clear plan for it. Let’s keep calm and focus on the task—once it’s done, we can adjust if needed.

Give me a moment to tie this first and make it stable. Once it’s done, we can refine it together.

We can build a bridge that’s supported at one end using manpower to stabilize it. This way, it can serve as a functional bridge to complete the task.

Make sure that we are able to carry all the resources as we move forward. We need to stay coordinated and ensure nothing is left behind as we progress.

I am analyzing the current structure to determine how we can move forward effectively.
